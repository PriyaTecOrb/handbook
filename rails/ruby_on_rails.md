## Why do you like Ruby on Rails?

Well, Ruby on Rails is primarily used for creating high-performance web platforms. It is also popular for its Rapid Application development and can easily be modified with required changes that helps developers to follow Agile Development Approach.

### Advantages of Ruby on Rails from the business perspective

#### Speed
- Ruby is clear, simple, logical, and has a lean code-base (allowing for fewer lines of redundant code) resulting in accelerated development speed. 
- Add Rails, and you’ll see how it helps RoR developers to save time while coding and focus on providing better solutions. 
- Simply because less code means less time spent on writing it while the functionality remains the same. 

#### Cost-effectiveness
- Ruby on Rails is open-source which means the absence of licensing costs. 
- Because of the speed with which Rails websites can be built and modified, less money is spent on creating and maintaining them. 
- There are tons of gems, the developer can save plenty of time and effort to implement custom features.

#### Secure
- The framework is by default, installed and enabled with some security measures. 
- When you use Ruby in Rails, you are following a secure development process.

#### Scalable

There are lots of resources on the web that explain how to scale web applications and how to scale Ruby on Rails applications.

Here’s a quick summary of just five of the basic strategies for a scalable Ruby on Rails web application 

- Cache, cache, cache and more cache.
- Segregate data and data serving
- Minimize & handle external dependencies
- Tend your database and your job handlers
- Shard your unavoidably relational data

#### Rails testing terminology

Rails makes it super easy to write your tests. It starts by producing skeleton test code while you are creating your models and controllers.

We use RSpec tool to write tests for application features in most of the Ruby on Rails projects. TDD provides a novel and understandable way of writing tests that produces Test Driven Development even easier.

Here are some of the benefits of using RSpec:

- TDD makes the code simpler and clear. It allows the developer to maintain less documentation.
- TDD prevents bugs in production, forces better code.
- Encourages developers confidence when making changes to existing code bases.
- TDD promotes the development of high-quality code.

### Here are some of the popular Gems we have worked to implement below features:
