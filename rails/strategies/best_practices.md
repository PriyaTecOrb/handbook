## What are your best practices you promote when working with others in a Rails project?

Here are some of the best practices promoted when working with others in a Rails project:

### Use Popular Libraries instead of custom implementation

Should use popular libraries to maintain standard for security layers in below features instead of developing custom code chunks as these are commonly used in probably every project.
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Role-based permissions & control

Here are our Github Guidelines for the developers to follow while developing the features:
- [Popular Libraries](https://github.com/TecOrb-Developers/handbook/blob/main/rails/used_gems.md)

### Write Test Cases with the feature development

While implementing features should not forget to write Rspec Test Cases which reduces the changes of errors, bugs and increases the Project productivity for long run.

Here are our Github Guidelines for writing Rspec Test Cases during the development:
https://github.com/TecOrb-Developers/handbook/blob/main/rails/testing/rspec.md

### Use Exception Tracking and Coding Style tools

Should use error and exception monitoring tools like Sentry, Honeybadger etc while the development. These tools reduce the development time by tracking Exceptions/Errors with the created cause so Team will directly focus on fixing errors instead of spending more time in debugging.

Here are some of the popular Tracking & Monitoring tools on our Github Guidelines document:
- [Error/Exception Tracking Tools](https://github.com/TecOrb-Developers/handbook/blob/main/rails/used_gems.md#gems-for-issues-tracking--monitering)

Here are some of other tools documentation for Coding Style and Debugging tools that should also use while the development.
- [Coding styling Tools](https://github.com/TecOrb-Developers/handbook/blob/main/rails/used_gems.md#coding-style-gems)
- [Debugging Tools](https://github.com/TecOrb-Developers/handbook/blob/main/rails/used_gems.md#debugging-gems)

There are more detailed documented best practices we use to promote for the others in the project. Below is the link for our complete documentation Handbook.
